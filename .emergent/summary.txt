<analysis>An analysis of the user's requests, the agent's actions, and the codebase reveals that the agent successfully addressed a series of user-driven UI and content expansion requests. Initially, the user asked for significant navigation changes, which the agent implemented by creating a new navbar structure with hover-activated dropdowns and moving the Methodology section to the footer. The agent then fixed a bug where the Back to Conditions link was broken.

Following this, the user requested the implementation of a hybrid affiliate model. The agent responded by creating a Where to Find component on compound pages for affiliate links and adding a corresponding disclaimer to the site's footer.

The majority of the session was dedicated to fulfilling the user's open-ended requests to add more compounds and expand categories. The agent systematically added new pages for various healing modalities, including Ayurveda, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Naturopathy, Homeopathy, Functional Medicine, and Aromatherapy. For each new page, the agent also added relevant compounds to the database, increasing the total count from 104 to 178. The agent consistently verified its work using screenshots, confirming that the new pages were routed correctly, linked from the UI, and displayed the intended content. The session ended while the agent was in the middle of this expansion, having just created the pages for Functional Medicine and Aromatherapy.

**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to transform a 'EvidenceMed' build into a high-authority Institutional Archive.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Deletion:** Remove all affiliate links, marketing pop-ups, and 'salesy' CTA buttons. (Note: User later requested re-adding affiliate links in a hybrid model).
- **Simplification:** The navigation should be simplified.
- **Aesthetics & Code:** Retain the medical/clinical aesthetic and ensure a lean codebase.
- **Resources Page:** The 'Resources' page should be a bibliography of trusted links. A later request specified a hybrid model with affiliate links for books, herbs, and supplements.
- **Authentication:** The Member Resources section requires authentication.
- **New Features (from previous sessions):** Full JWT auth, live PubMed search, Research Alerts, Practitioners Repository, Institutional Pricing/Access pages, Weekly Research Digest, Admin Dashboard, User Profiles, citation export, social sharing, fuzzy search, PWA, AI search summary, practitioner verification system, and a public Practitioner Directory.
- **New Features (this session):**
    - Rework the main navigation to use specific headings (Medical Conditions, Research Library, Natural Compounds, Integrative Therapies).
    - Implement hover-activated dropdown menus for the new navigation.
    - Implement a hybrid affiliate system with a Where to Buy section on compound pages and a disclaimer in the footer.
    - Restore/create a dedicated page for Ayurveda.
    - Create dedicated pages for other healing modalities like Traditional Chinese Medicine, Naturopathy, Homeopathy, Functional Medicine, and Aromatherapy.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a comprehensive full-stack institutional research archive built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. Key features include JWT authentication, an admin dashboard, live PubMed search with an AI assistant, user profiles, practitioner verification and annotation systems, and a public practitioner directory. The navigation has been completely reworked to feature hover-activated dropdown menus. The site's content has been significantly expanded with new, detailed pages for Ayurveda, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Naturopathy, and Homeopathy. Pages for Functional Medicine and Aromatherapy have also just been created. The compound database now contains 178 entries.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** Fulfilling the user's request to add more options by expanding the integrative therapies content. The agent created pages for Functional Medicine and Aromatherapy, added them to the app's routing and navigation, and added 9 new related compounds (essential oils) to the database.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** Y (Verified the Functional Medicine page via screenshot, but not the Aromatherapy page yet).
- **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending bugs. The work is focused on new feature and content development.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Complete and Verify Expansion of Therapy Categories (P0)**
    - **Where to resume:** The agent just created pages for Functional Medicine and Aromatherapy. The next step is to take a screenshot of the  page to verify it loads correctly, similar to how the  page was verified.
    - **What will be achieved with this?** This will complete the current batch of content expansion requested by the user.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** frontend
    - **Blocked on something:** None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**

- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - (P0) After verifying the Aromatherapy page, ask the user if they are satisfied with the recent content expansion or if they want to add even more categories (e.g., expand on Unani Medicine, or add a new section).
    - (P1) Implement real tracking parameters (e.g., Amazon Associates tag, iHerb referral code) for the affiliate links in the  component. Currently, they are placeholder links.
- **Future Tasks:**
    - (P2) Set up a true automated scheduler (e.g., cron job) for the weekly research digest email ().
    - (P2) Create a dedicated, browsable Resources page for books and journals, as the current implementation is a sidebar on compound pages.
    - (P2) Review and potentially re-implement charting functionality in .
    - (P3) Consider migrating the ever-growing  file to a database collection for better scalability and management.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, .
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, MongoDB ().
- **UI Technique:** Custom hover-activated dropdown menus were built using React state () and conditional CSS classes, as the existing component library's dropdowns are click-based.

**key DB schema**
- No changes were made to the database schema in this session.

**changes in tech stack**
- No changes to the tech stack were made in this session.

**All files of reference**
- **Created:**
    - : Displays affiliate links on compound pages.
    - : New page for Traditional Chinese Medicine.
    - : New page for Naturopathic Medicine.
    - : New page for Homeopathy.
    - : New page for Functional Medicine.
    - : New page for Aromatherapy.
- **Updated:**
    - : Overhauled for new links and custom hover dropdowns.
    - : Updated with new routes for all the created pages.
    - : Updated multiple times to add 74 new compounds.
    - : Updated to feature and link to the new medicine system pages.
    - : Updated to add the affiliate disclaimer.
    - : Updated to fix the 'Back to Conditions' link.
    - : Updated to remove the non-functional 'Shop' section.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The static file  is now over 5,600 lines long. It is becoming difficult to manage and could be a candidate for migration to a MongoDB collection to improve performance and maintainability.

**key api endpoints**
- No new API endpoints were created or modified in this session.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The user is currently focused on rapid content expansion. They provide open-ended requests like expand or add more, and they have been very receptive to the agent's strategy of creating new, richly detailed pages for each topic. Be prepared to continue this pattern.
- The navigation dropdowns are a custom implementation using React state and CSS for the hover effect, not a standard library component. Be mindful of this if making future changes to the navbar.
- The  file is the single source of truth for compounds. Any new additions must be made there.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-  (updated multiple times)
